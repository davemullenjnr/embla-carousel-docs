# API

The vision for Embla Carousel is a **lightweight** bare bones carousel library. It aims to solve the **hardest technical** challenges with building great carousels. This comes with the benefit of **not burdening** users with a bunch of **features they don't need**.

But Embla Carousel shouldn't be limited to just its core features. That's why the Embla Carousel API is **designed** with **extensibility in mind**, and it exposes a **rich API** that can **easily be extended** to cover most of the use cases for carousels.
