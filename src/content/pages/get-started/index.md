# Get Started

Embla Carousel is a **lightweight** carousel library with great fluid motion and awesome swipe precision. It's library agnostic, **dependency free** and 100% **open source**. Build awesome carousels by extending Embla Carousel with your own CSS and JavaScript. It works in all modern browsers including IE 11.

Embla Carousel can easily be installed in every **JavaScript** or **TypeScript project** built for the web, either using a package manager or a CDN.
